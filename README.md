## üöÄ HACKUTD: Toyota's Challenge Solution

### REGEN MODEL

This is our solution for Toyota's challenge to develop innovative consumer benefits. We envisioned a model that would improve customer satisfaction by offering intelligent route suggestions, enhancing EV efficiency, and promoting sustainable driving practices.

Our vision utilizes the regenerative braking feature of electric vehicles (EVs) to maximize efficiency. We've engineered a system that allows users to choose routes optimized for increased mileage, favoring surface roads over highways. This smart routing not only extends the range of EVs but also improves the overall driving experience by ensuring minimal energy loss.

## Project Vision

The **REGEN MODEL** leverages the **regenerative braking** capabilities of EVs to:
-  Extend driving range by reducing energy loss
-  Promote sustainable driving behavior
-  Provide intelligent route suggestions that favor energy-efficient paths

Instead of defaulting to highways, our system recommends routes that prioritize routes where regenerative braking can be more effectively utilized ‚Äî ultimately maximizing energy recovery and enhancing mileage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **JavaScript**
- **HTML/CSS**
- **Google Maps API**
- **Google Directions API**

---

## üåç How It Works

1. The user enters their destination.
2. The system calculates multiple route options.
3. Routes are evaluated based on terrain, stop frequency, and regenerative braking potential.
4. The most **efficient** route is recommended ‚Äî not just the fastest one.

---

## üí° Why This Matters

EV owners often have to choose between speed and efficiency. The REGEN MODEL gives them a **third option** ‚Äî an optimized route that balances travel time with **maximum energy recovery**.

This not only improves the daily driving experience but supports long-term **sustainability** and **battery health**.
