## ðŸš€ HACKUTD: Toyota's Challenge Solution

### REGEN MODEL

This is our solution for Toyota's challenge to develop innovative consumer benefits. 

Our vision utilizes the regenerative braking feature of electric vehicles (EVs) to maximize efficiency. We've engineered a system that enables users to choose routes optimized for increased mileage, often favoring surface roads over highways. This smart routing not only extends the range of EVs but also improves the overall driving experience by ensuring minimal energy loss.
