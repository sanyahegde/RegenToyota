## ðŸš€ HACKUTD: Toyota's Challenge Solution

### REGEN MODEL

This is our solution for Toyota's challenge to develop innovative consumer benefits. We envisioned a model that would improve customer satisfaction by offering intelligent route suggestions, enhancing EV efficiency, and promoting sustainable driving practices.

Our vision utilizes the regenerative braking feature of electric vehicles (EVs) to maximize efficiency. We've engineered a system that allows users to choose routes optimized for increased mileage, favoring surface roads over highways. This smart routing not only extends the range of EVs but also improves the overall driving experience by ensuring minimal energy loss.
