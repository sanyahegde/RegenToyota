# RegenToyota
HACKUTD

This is our HACKUTD solution for Toyota's challenge statement. 

Our idea was to create a solution based on an EV vehicle's regenerative braking feature so that users could opt into a route that gives them more mileage to get to their destination. 
Most often the new route would use surface roads rather than highways so that the car could allow for more miles to not be lost.
